# About this Project
**Purpose:** to provide a platform for individuals to monitor and track changes in air quality and therefore provide at least some level of insight into the hands of people that wish to monitor such issues

Air quality is an often underestimated factor that plays a pivotal role in our overall well-being. As the human population continues to grow in size, so will the amount of urban environments that accompany such an increase. According to an article by The World Bank, some 56% of the world's population, or 4.4 billion individuals, already live in densely populated cities, with 70% of individuals expected to be living in similar conditions by the year 2050 (“Urban Development Overview”). This trend will likely only lead to higher rates of air pollution and therefore become a topic of concern for many, especially those with preexisting health conditions.
